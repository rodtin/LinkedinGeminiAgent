Story: The 2026 technology narrative is clear: AI becomes scalable, governed value across enterprises, with hybrid cloud and security as core capabilities.

These stories converge on embedding GenAI into day-to-day processes, governed AI, and secure, interoperable infrastructures that enable scalable value with measurable sustainability. Leaders who institutionalize AI responsibly, scale deployments across hybrid/multi-cloud environments, and forge open, secure ecosystems will win; hesitation compounds risk of losing competitiveness in a hyper-connected, data-driven world.

Shout-out to the teams turning these narratives into real-world value across ops, security, and networking.
