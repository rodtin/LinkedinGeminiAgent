prompt = """
You are tasked with publishing a LinkedIn post for Rodrigo Tinte.

**Instructions:**
1. **Identify Content:** Search the `News Agent/Posts/` directory for the most recent markdown file that does **NOT** start with `POSTED_`.
2. **Verify:** Read the file content briefly to ensure it looks like a valid post draft.
3. **Publish:** Use the `run_shell_command` tool to execute the posting script using `uv`:
   `cd Application && uv run --env-file .env post_linkedin.py "../<path_to_latest_post>"`
   *(Note: Ensure relative paths are correct, or use absolute paths)*
4. **Handle Output:**
   - If the script runs successfully, confirm the action to the user and mention the file was renamed.
   - If the script fails (e.g., missing credentials), explain clearly that the user needs to set the `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `LINKEDIN_URN_ID` in the `Application/.env` file.

**Context:**
- You are automating the "last mile" of the content creation process.
- The script uses `python-dotenv` to load credentials from `Application/.env`.
- The script automatically renames the file to `POSTED_<filename>` upon success.
